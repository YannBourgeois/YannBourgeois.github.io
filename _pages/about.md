 My research has mostly revolved around molecular ecology and evolutionary biology.
 I am especially interested in using advanced genomic tools to understand the past history of species that are representative of biodiversity, as well as quantifying the link between fitness and genotypes.
 More recently, I have started developing projects on the population dynamics of transposable elements, which are involved in a strong coevolutionary interaction with their host. The study of TEs is fascinating as it contributes to break away from a linear view of the genome.

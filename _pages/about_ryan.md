## Jasmine Ryan (PhD student)

Jasmine obtained her Masters degree from the University of Montpellier (France) in 2025, 
and is funded by the   <a href="https://www.umontpellier.fr/en/recherche/unites-de-recherche/pole-aeb-presentation"> Agriculture-Environment-Biodiversity Division </a> from the University of Montpellier. Her project will focus on the
population genomics of _Coffea canephora_, the plant used to produce robusta coffee. She will particularly focus on the mutation load and adaptive potential associated with polymorphic transposable elements, and determine how past environmental 
changes may have shaped current genomic diversity in the species. Her project is co-supervised by Yann Bourgeois,  <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/cnmeynard/home"> Dr. Christine Meynard </a>, who is an expert in species distribution modeling, 
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Valerie-Poncet"> Dr. Valérie Poncet </a> and <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0247-6400"> Dr. Rémi Tournebize <a>, both experts in the genomics of Coffea canephora, among other skills!

I have acquired a substantial teaching experience at the University of Portsmouth, from 2020 to 2022. 
I was responsible for courses in genetics, bioinformatics, and genomics. I also recently contributed with Thibault Leroy to an  <a href="https://github.com/PhysaliaIntroPopGen/November2024">online Physalia course</a> on population genomics.


Work on this page is in progress, but I intend to provide links to various documents and tutorials in html format.

## Physalia courses

You can find an introduction to population structure inference and admixture [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/html/1_teaching.html). The example deals with recent research on date palm.

## Lectures and workshops at Portsmouth University.

You can find a quick introduction to coding with Linux [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/Workshop_UNIX_1.pdf)

## Lectures at the University of Montpellier.

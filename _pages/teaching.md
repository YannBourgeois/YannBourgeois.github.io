I have acquired a substantial teaching experience at the University of Portsmouth, from 2020 to 2022. 
I was responsible for courses in genetics, bioinformatics, and genomics. I also recently contributed with Thibault Leroy to an  <a href="https://github.com/PhysaliaIntroPopGen/November2024">online Physalia course</a> on population genomics.


Work on this page is in progress, but I intend to provide links to various documents and tutorials in html format.

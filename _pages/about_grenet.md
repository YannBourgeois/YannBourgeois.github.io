## Valentin Grenet (PhD student)

Valentin obtained his Masters degree from Polytech Nice Sophia in 2024. His project
consisted in annotating LTR retrotransposons in the date palm reference genome. He
has succeeded in obtaining consensus sequences for the most abundant lineages of
LTR-RTs, has described their diversity through phylogenetic methods, and has estimated the age of complete LTR-RTs and solo LTRs.
During his PhD project, he will contrast the age
and abundance of elements with genomic features (recombination,
gene density, base content etc.) to investigate the interaction between TEs and their
host. Nanopore data will be used to further investigate the abundance and frequency
of polymorphic elements.

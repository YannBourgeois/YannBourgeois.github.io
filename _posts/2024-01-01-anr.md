I am happy to report that our ANR project, DaTEPalm, has been funded. 
This project will work on obtaining a diversity panel of palms sequenced with ONT/Nanopore, focusing on polymorphic transposable elements (TEs). The funding covers a PhD and a post-doctoral researcher.
The official summary is reproduced below, and can be found [here](https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-23-CE20-0017).

There are two articles that I wish to bookmark here. The [first one](https://doi.org/10.1111/eva.70121) is a review on methods designed for (mostly recent) changes in the effective population size. It will be useful to update the tables on the methodspopgen.com website.

The [second one](https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.17670) is a valuable review by Waples that clarifies many things about the effective population size, what it means, and what it is not (NOT the number of individuals that reproduce, see also Figure 2 [here](https://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esac023)). There is also an interesting discussion about whether one should remove related individuals or not before running demographic analyses.

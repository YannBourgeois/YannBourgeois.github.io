I am happy to report that our publication on urban green anoles (_Anolis carolinensis_) has been published in open access in Molecular Ecology! We looked at the accumulation of mutation load, spatial isolation and signatures of adaptation in an urban population in New Orleans, compared to other localities nearby. 
One of the most striking result, which emerged from following a reviewer's recommendation ([Dr. Winchell](https://kmwinchell.com/)), was that the HOXC cluster fell in the middle of the strongest signal of association and differentiation we could observe!
You can read the paper [here](https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.70057), and access the scripts [here](https://github.com/YannBourgeois/Scripts_urban_anolis_lowdepth). I intend to turn this into a tutorial at some point, which may cover imputation without a reference panel. We used STITCH, which seems to work very well even with only 100 samples. 
I heard that it works well in haplotagging experiments, which provide phase information that helps reconstructing genotypes accurately.

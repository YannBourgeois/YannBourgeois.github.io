|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| POPGenome  |  Differentiation/Diversity/Recombination  |  Computing summary statistics based on AFS and LD along genomes  |  Accepts VCF and GFF/GFT files, efficient and fast. Tests for admixture available (ABBA BABA test). Includes basic coalescence simulations (ms and msms)  |  Mostly limited to summary statistics (but coalescent simulations are possible). No built-in SNP calling module  |  http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/  |  (Pfeifer et al., 2014)    | 
| ANGSD  |  Differentiation/Diversity/Recombination  |  Computing summary statistics based on AFS and LD along genomes  |  Able to process BAM files, built-in procedures for data filtering, admixture analysis. Suited for low-depth data. Includes a suite of methods to estimate relatedness (NGSRelate).  |  Mostly limited to summary statistics. Tutorials not always up-to-date.  |  https://github.com/ANGSD/angsd ; https://github.com/ANGSD/NgsRelate  |  (Korneliussen et al., 2014; HanghÃ¸j et al., 2019)    | 
| Arlequin  |  Differentiation/Diversity/Recombination  |  Computing summary statistics based on AFS and LD along genomes  |  Can output AFS for further analysis in fastsimcoal2  |  Slower than PopGenome, requires a specific format and file conversion.  |  http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/arlequin35/Arl35Downloads.html  |  (Excoffier and Lischer, 2010)    | 
| VCFTOOLS  |  Differentiation/Diversity/Recombination  |  Computing summary statistics based on AFS and LD along genomes  |  Fast. VCFTOOLS can also be used for SNP filtering  |  Less summary statistics than POPGenome  |  https://vcftools.github.io/man_latest.html  |  (Danecek et al., 2011)    | 
| ATLAS  |  Differentiation/Diversity/Recombination  |  Low depth sequencing/ancient samples analsis  |  Particularly suited for analyzing ancient samples. Includes sets of tools to call variants, estimate post-mortem damage, inbreeding, genetic diversity. Produces the input file for PSMC (demography from a single diploid genome)  |  Better used in combination with GATK pipelines. Still in development  |  https://bitbucket.org/wegmannlab/atlas/wiki/Home  |  (Link et al., 2017)    |

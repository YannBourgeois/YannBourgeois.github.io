The argan tree (_Argania spinosa L._) is an endemic species of Morocco and Algeria, with significant cultural, economic, and ecological importance. 
As the only non-tropical Sapotaceae and a transitional species between Mediterranean and desert environments, its evolutionary history and ecology remain poorly understood. 
This project aims to provide an initial insight into these aspects by generating data (Illumina sequencing of around forty individuals) to initiate research on this species within our UMR in collaboration with local partners. 
The project involves personnel from the DYNADIV and ADvENS teams and is part of an ongoing ecological and archaeobotanical study at ISEM, enabling the rapid valorization of results and contributing to future funding applications.
